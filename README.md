METHODOLOGY 

Requirements Gathering:

Define the specific requirements for your inventory management system. Understand what data needs to be tracked (e.g., products, quantities, suppliers, customers), what operations are required (e.g., adding items, updating stock), and what reporting and analytics are necessary


Database Design:

Design a database schema to store inventory-related data like MySQL
UI Design:
Creating a user interface if your inventory management system requires it. We use GUI in our project.
Coding and Development:

Implement the core functionality of the inventory management system. This includes writing Java classes to interact with the database, handle business logic, and provide a user interface if necessary.
Inventory Tracking:
Implement features to add, insert, update, and delete products in the inventory. Each product should have attributes like name, productCode, price, and quantity in stock.
Maintenance and Updates:

Regularly maintain the application, address bug fixes, and add new features as needed. Continuously monitor the system's performance and optimize where necessary.
